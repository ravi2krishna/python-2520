    -> Learning Management System (LMS)

    -> Idea : How to use classes, objects and methods.

    -> Simulation of Grading and Payment System within LMS 

        -> Grading - Student 

        -> Payment - Trainer 

    -> The project is designed to help us understand how classes work together
        by defining methods and passing the data across the classes 

    -> Student Module 

        -> Student Info (ID, Name, Age etc)
        -> Attendance 
        -> Performance Based On Score 
        -> Trainer Rating 
        -> etc 

        -> Have Hover Like Functionality, which shows basic info like ID & Name 

        -> Have Click Like Functionality, which shows complete info like 
            ID, Name, Age, Email, Mobile Number 

        -> Ask student for number of sessions attended 

            -> 30 or more sessions attended add 5 Credits 
            -> 20-29 sessions attended add 3 Credits 
            -> Below 20 sessions attended add 0 Credits 

        -> Accept a score and based on score give credits 

            -> 85 and above score add 5 Credits 
            -> 60-84 score range add 3 Credits 
            -> Below 60 score add 0 Credits 

        -> Calculate final credits based on above 

            -> 10 Credits give 1st 
            -> 8-9 Credits give 2nd 
            -> Below 8 give 3rd

    -> Trainer Module 

        -> Trainer Info (ID, Name)

        -> Ask for number of sessions taken by trainer 

        -> Calculate payment for taking sessions, per session 2000

        -> Ask Student Rating for Trainer (1-5) 

            -> Rating is 5 : Give 5000 bonus 
            -> Otherwise : Give 0 bonus 

        -> Calculate Total Payment For Sessions 

    -> 3 months later new requirement 

        -> Calculate Course Fee Functionality 

            -> Actual Course Fee is 30000

            -> Student can give COUPON for discount on Course Fee

                -> if COUPON is "PROMO" give 5000 discount 

                -> if COUPON is "FIFTY" give 15000 discount 

            -> Also apply some Global Site Wide Discount - 10% 

        -> Based On Above Functionality Display 

            -> Original Course Fee 

            -> Discount Applied Via COUPON

            -> Global Discount 

            -> Final Course Fee To Pay

        -> Based on the system observation till now, see if calculations info data 
            is needed as instance members and optimize if required

        -> Our old def performance_credits_cal() is more of hardcoded 

            -> Change it to be more dynamic 

                -> Take some complex data structure to take multiple scores 
                from the student like in our crud app 
                    (Enter Score or type done: " ) 
                
                -> From this multiple scores take the average and this value should 
                be given to performance_credits_cal(average)
